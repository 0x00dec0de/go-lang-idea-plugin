<p>Package io provides basic interfaces to I/O primitives.</p>
<p>Its primary job is to wrap existing implementations of such primitives,</p>
<p>such as those in package os, into shared public interfaces that</p>
<p>abstract the functionality, plus some other related primitives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because these interfaces and primitives wrap lower-level operations with</p>
<p>various implementations, unless otherwise informed clients should not</p>
<p>assume they are safe for parallel execution.</p>
