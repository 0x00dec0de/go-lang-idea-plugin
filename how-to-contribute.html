<h1>How to contribute</h1>
<p>We appreciate any contribution you can have on this project: testing &amp; reporting bugs, coding, etc.</p>
<h4>For testing &amp; reporting bugs</h4>
<p>
If you are already using Intellj IDEA as your main development IDE then you just need to install the <em>Google Go Language</em> plugin using the Plugin manager and then trying your hand at writing a go program. If you find anything amiss (annoyances, bugs, misfeatures, etc) you should report them in the <a href="ihttps://github.com/mtoader/google-go-lang-idea-plugin/issues">go-ide issue tracker</a>.
If not then you should follow the <a href="">go-ide guickstart guide</a> to install it on your machine and report anything you find amiss to out issue tracker.</p>

<h4>For coders</h4>
<p>
You will need to install an IntelliJ IDEA plugin development environment and you will need to be somewhat familiar with Java coding. Fork &amp; checkout the code from <a href="https://github.com/mtoader/google-go-lang-idea-plugin">go-ide source code</a>, do your business and once you have completed your changes (and run the test cases) send a pull request. We will take a look and if everyhing goes well we will integrate it an do a release. We will also help you with anything we can if you ask for help :)</p>
