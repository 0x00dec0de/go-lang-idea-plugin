To install the plugin, visit the [readme](https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin#pre-release-builds).

This release focuses mostly on fixes and improvements. It contains fixes in resolution algorithms and in running tests mechanism.

## Read/Write access

### New inspections and quick fixes

In this release, the part which is responsible for detecting read/write access to variables was completely rewritten. Based on this the new inspection  `_ used as value inspection` is introduced and added new `Replace with ':='` quick fix for unresolved variables with write access.

### Improved inspections and quick fixes

Also `Introduce constants` quick fix won't be suggested for unresolved variables with write access and `Cannot assign to constant` catches more cases now.

### Find usages grouping

Grouping by read/write access in find usages works more accurate as well.

## Run configurations

Now you can see real `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` values which are used during compilation and running your application. Also, now there is an easy way to restart run configuration after compilation error.
