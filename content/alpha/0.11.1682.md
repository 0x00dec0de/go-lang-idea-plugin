## Changes


### Editing

- `Create Function` quick fix is available now! It's quite smart and suggests to create function
with appropriate types or with `interface{}` types if the original types are not allowed to use
{{% fluid_img "/images/1654/create_function.gif" %}}
- implemented move statement up/move down actions
<br/>for variable declarations
{{% fluid_img "/images/1654/moving_statement_1.gif" %}}
and for block statements
{{% fluid_img "/images/1654/moving_statement_2.gif" %}}
- the plugin will now correctly insert `\n` in strings when requested to do so
{{% fluid_img src = "/images/1654/enter_in_string_literal.gif" width = "319px" %}}
- complete statement action (`Cmd+Shift+Enter`) has been improved
{{% fluid_img src = "/images/1654/smart_enter.gif" width = "300px" %}}
- added icons on editor gutter to easy run applications and tests
{{% fluid_img src = "/images/1654/run_app_gutter.png" width = "334px" %}}
{{% fluid_img src = "/images/1654/run_test_gutter.png" width = "390px" %}}
- added surround action
{{% fluid_img "/images/1654/surround.gif" %}}

### Completion

- functions parameters info are now displayed just after completing function or method
{{% fluid_img src = "/images/1654/parameter_info_on_completion.gif" width = "300px" %}}
- `range` keyword completion
- `type` keyword completion inside blocks

- improve completion in struct literals:
  - do not suggest field names when value initializer is used.
  - do not suggest values when field:value initializer is used.
  - only show unassigned fields in completion list.
{{% fluid_img src = "/images/1654/struct_literal_completion.png" width = "370px" %}}

### Inspections

- added an inspection which highlights redundant declarations and provides corresponding cleanup actions
{{% fluid_img src = "/images/1654/cleanup_fixes.gif" width = "300px" %}}
- iterations on pointer to slices are not valid and there's now a new inspection to warn you about this
{{% fluid_img src = "/images/1654/cannot_range_on_pointer_to_array.png" width = "399px" %}}
- placeholder count inspection is now valid for Logf, Skipf, Errorf and Fatalf
- defer inspection has now a quickfix to convert functions to function calls
{{% fluid_img src = "/images/1654/defer_function_call.png" width = "326px" %}}

### Debugger

- Delve has been been upgraded to support passing parameters on Windows (along many other internal fixes in Delve)
- The new version of Delve contains the fix of race condition which was lead to skipping breakpoints while debugging with IDE

### Other

- completion, unused inspections and find usages action speed should be better overall and use 
less memory for auto-import completion
- improved type calculation for nested types
- the plugin won't autocomplete live templates in comments anymore
- the plugin won't nag you about the wiki page every time you install a new version
- a new theme based on Darcula is now based
- improved output of tests that pass
- introduce variable refactoring will now suggest names based on expression type being used

Many other changes and fixes have been introduced to increase the overall stability, functionality and performance of the plugin.
