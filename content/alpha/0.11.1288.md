Changes since 0.11.1262 (05.04.2016)

This release focuses mostly on fixes. The most critical issues which were fixed in this release are auto-importing packages from unreachable `testdata` directories and resolving `cap` expressions.

Also here are couple improvements which this release brings:

### Go vet tool

`go vet` tool is built-in tool now and can be invoked on selected file or directory via `Code | Go Tools | Go vet` menu or via editor menu.

### Expression Type

`Show info` action is reimplemented using built-in `Expression Type` action which is available by `Alt+=` (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Mac) shortcut. Also it works now on variable/constant definitions.

### Autoscroll from source and Navigate in... features

Since this release it's possible to use `Autoscroll form source` mode in `File structure` tool window for `go` sources. `Navigate to... | File Structure` action works now as well.
