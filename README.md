## Pre-release builds

Pre-release builds are available in two forms: nightly and alphas. At the time
of writing, alpha builds are released usually at the start of every week while
nightly builds are released every night, using the latest buildable source.

To use them, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Follow [the instructions](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/managing-enterprise-plugin-repositories.html)
1. Paste the url for the version you desire:
 - alpha: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/alpha/list
 - nightly: https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugins/nightly/list

As always, please remember that this is an alpha release and while efforts are
made to ensure the best possible experience, sometimes things might be broken.

Reporting issues is very important for us as such, please see the section below
on how to submit a proper bug report.
